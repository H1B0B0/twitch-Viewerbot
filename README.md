## Installation

### Standard Installation

1. Download the executable from the [releases page](https://github.com/H1B0B0/twitch-Viewerbot/releases)
2. Launch the application
3. Login or register an account
4. Configure your settings
5. Start the bot

### Development Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/H1B0B0/twitch-Viewerbot.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd twitch-Viewerbot
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Build the static Frontend:

   **Windows**

   ```shell
   ./build.ps1
   ```

   **Linux / macOS**

   ```shell
   ./build.sh
   ```

5. Launch the backend:
   ```shell
   python ./backend/main.py --dev
   ```

### Server Installation

To deploy the application on a server with remote access:

1. Install Certbot for Let's Encrypt:

   ```shell
   # Debian/Ubuntu
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install certbot

   # CentOS/RHEL
   sudo yum install certbot

   # Make sure you have the latest version
   sudo certbot --version
   ```

2. Make sure your domain points to your server's IP address and ports 80 and 443 are open

   - **Important**: Port 80 must be free during the certificate issuance process
   - Temporarily stop any services using port 80 (like Apache or Nginx)

3. You can manually obtain a certificate first (recommended approach):

   ```shell
   sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com
   ```

4. Copy the generated certificates to the application's certs directory:

   ```shell
   # Create certs directory if it doesn't exist
   mkdir -p ./backend/certs

   # Copy the certificates (adjust paths as needed)
   sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem ./backend/certs/yourdomain.com.cert
   sudo cp /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem ./backend/certs/yourdomain.com.key
   ```

5. Launch the application with domain and email arguments:

   ```shell
   sudo python ./backend/main.py --domain yourdomain.com --email your@email.com --no-browser
   ```

6. Access the application securely at https://yourdomain.com

For detailed instructions, see the [Server Setup Guide](docs/SERVER_SETUP.md).

#### Troubleshooting Certificate Issues

If Let's Encrypt certification fails, the application will automatically fall back to HTTP mode. Common issues include:

- **Domain not properly configured** - Ensure your domain properly points to your server's IP
- **Ports not open** - Make sure ports 80 and 443 are open in your firewall
- **Port 80 in use** - Temporarily stop any web servers or services using port 80
- **Verification timeout** - Let's Encrypt servers must be able to reach your domain
- **Certbot issues** - Try updating certbot or running it manually:
  ```shell
  sudo certbot certonly --standalone -d yourdomain.com
  ```
- **Check logs** - Look for `certbot_error.log` in the backend directory

## Usage

### For End Users

1. Open your web browser and navigate to `https://velbots.shop`
2. Enter the number of threads you want to run
3. Enter the name of the Twitch channel you want to generate views for
4. (Optional) Upload your custom proxy list
5. Click the "Start bot" button to begin generating views

### For Developers

- The `--dev` flag enables development mode
- Check the console for logs and debugging information
- Frontend code is located in the `frontend` directory
- Backend API endpoints are defined in `backend/main.py`

### For Server Deployment

- Use the `--domain` parameter to specify your domain name
- Use the `--email` parameter to provide an email for Let's Encrypt registration
- Use the `--renew` flag to force certificate renewal
- Use the `--no-browser` flag to prevent the application from opening a browser
- Run the application with sudo or as root to bind to port 443
- The application will automatically fall back to HTTP mode on port 80 if certificates are unavailable

```shell
# Running with Let's Encrypt (preferred secure mode)
sudo python ./backend/main.py --domain yourdomain.com --email your@email.com --no-browser

# Running in development mode
python ./backend/main.py --dev
```

#### Security Notes

- When certificates are unavailable, the application will fall back to unsecure HTTP mode
- In HTTP mode, your data is not encrypted during transmission
- For production use, it's recommended to ensure valid certificates are available
- You can manually obtain certificates and place them in the `backend/certs/` directory as:
  - `yourdomain.com.cert` (the fullchain.pem from Let's Encrypt)
  - `yourdomain.com.key` (the privkey.pem from Let's Encrypt)

## macOS Installation Guide
